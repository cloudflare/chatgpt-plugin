# ChatGPT Plugins on Cloudflare

This repo contains Cloudflare's work with ChatGPT plugins. The plugins are built using the [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) platform.

- [`example-plugin`](https://github.com/cloudflare/chatgpt-plugin/tree/main/example-plugin): An example plugin that can be deployed to Cloudflare Workers in 5 minutes, allowing search and retrieval of GitHub repositories.
- [`example-weather-plugin`](https://github.com/cloudflare/chatgpt-plugin/tree/main/example-weather-plugin): An example plugin that retrieves weather information from the [Pirate Weather API](https://pirate-weather.apiable.io/).
